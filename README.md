# Git Assignment - <KathrynVozoris>

a. What is an issue?

Issues are suggested improvements, tasks or questions related to the repository. There is a discussion enabled under the issue, which contributors can add to.

b. What is a pull request?

A pull request is a mechanism to allow for review and feedback on proposed changes before they are added to the repository.

c. Describe the steps to open a pull request?

Click on "Pull Requests" in the menu displayed at the top of your github webpage. Then click on the green "New Pull Request" button on the right hand side. Then choose the two branches you want to compare.

d. Describe the steps to add a collaborator to a repository (share write permissions)

Got to "Settings" in the menu at the top of your repository webpage. Click on "Collaborators" on the left and then on the green button "add people". Type in the Github username of the people you wish to add.

e. What is the difference between git and GitHub?

Git is a version control system, where you save versions of a project. GitHub is an online hosting service for git repositories.

f. What does git diff do?

A diff is the difference in changes between two commits, or saved changes. The diff will visually describe what was added or removed from a file since its last commit.

g. What is the main branch?

The main branch is the default branch. It is also the initial branch created when the repository is first made.

h. Besides our initial commit if it is a new repository, should we directly push our changes directly into the main branch?

We should stage our changes first on the repository, before pushing them. Creating a new branch allows us to diverge from the main line to do work without accidentally messing with the main branch. This helps with testing without making any accidental changes to the working branch.
